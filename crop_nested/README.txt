What in the world is this thing?

A content editor can crop an image two times: once "nest", once "egg".
The egg crop is restricted to being inside the nest crop, as validated
by the field widget in this module.

To use this, you must create crops and image styles that have identical
machine names. The image styles should use the corresponding manual crop.
There should be no other changes to the size of the image (like scales or crops).

Future work should be done to allow scaling to be added to the image styles.

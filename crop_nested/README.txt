What in the world is this thing?

A content editor can crop an image two times: once "nest", once "egg".
The egg crop is restricted to being inside the nest crop, as validated
by the field widget in this module. When the image is displayed, it looks 
like the egg version but the image can expand smoothly into the nest
version. Currently that happens on click.

This module is a demo of how one might use the crop_nested module.
On install, two crops and two image styles will be created. They
(clearly) correspond to nest and egg. Feel free to reconfigure
the scale effect on the nest and the crop parameters. But beware:
the egg crop and the nest crop must have the same aspect ratio
for this to work. On any image field, select the Crop Nested field
widget and the Zoom field formatter. Set the nest and egg to Zoom Nest
and Zoom Egg respectively. Then have fun! Everything should be set up
to get your cool zoom effect when the mouse hovers over the image.

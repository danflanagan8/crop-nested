It's really a work in progress...

As of commit f9C094d these are things for the future...

==Image Styles==
Need to add install config for the "featured" and "thumb" image styles
and give them better names.

==Crops==
Same thing for crops.

==FieldFormatter==
Need to override the parent settings/summary so that it always uses the
"featured" image style. Maybe need to clean up viewElements so that it
specifically loads the "featured" and "thumb" crops instead of all crops.

==FieldWidget==
Similar to FieldFormatter. Need to override parent settings/summary so
that it always uses the "featured" and "thumb" crops.

==JS/CSS==
Maybe need to rework things so that it is responsive. Maybe some things could
be changed from px to percentages.

==In General==
There are lots of things that could be named better all over this module.

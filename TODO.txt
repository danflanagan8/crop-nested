It's really a work in progress...

As of commit f9C094d these are things for the future...

==Image Styles==
Need to add install config for the "featured" and "thumb" image styles
and give them better names.

==Crops==
Same thing for crops.

**UPDATE**: Made updates to widget and formatter such that the "nest" and "egg"
are configurable. The expectation is that a crop has the same machine name
as the corresponding style. If the image style changes the size of the image
in any way other than manual crop this will break. Perhaps a sub module could
be created that creates a set of nest/egg crop/image_styles in case someone
wants that to happen easily.

==FieldFormatter==
Need to override the parent settings/summary so that it always uses the
"featured" image style. Maybe need to clean up viewElements so that it
specifically loads the "featured" and "thumb" crops instead of all crops.

**UPDATE**: Field formatter is configurable in that the nest and egg styles
can be set in configuration.

==FieldWidget==
Similar to FieldFormatter. Need to override parent settings/summary so
that it always uses the "featured" and "thumb" crops.

**UPDATE**: The field widget can be configured now. The user can select the nest
and egg crops that will be validated. If the nest style is the original iamge
then the standard imageCropWidget should be used since there is no need
for validation.

==JS/CSS==
Maybe need to rework things so that it is responsive. Maybe some things could
be changed from px to percentages.

==In General==
There are lots of things that could be named better all over this module.
